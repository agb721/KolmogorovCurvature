# KolmogorovCurvature
This code was used for an audiovidual installation that was shown at the Berlin University of the Arts in 2023.

The Python script takes visual input (ideally a single-color painting on canvas) and outputs a coefficient for how large the images compression factor would be.
The SuperCollider Script receives the outputted coefficients and uses them as variables inside digital sound synthesizer code.
